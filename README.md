# Weather-Time-Series
The objective of this notebook is to demonstrate different methods of time series analysis given average daily temperatures in one city over a few years.
Typically there are a few patterns that can be measured. They are the trend which is the difference in mean over time, seasonality which is repetitive patterns in the data, and increase or decrease to the range of values over time. Once these patterns are understood then models can provide estimates of average temperature for a 
given day in the future.
